## Understanding Collision Mesh for Robot

A collision mesh is a streamlined geometric model employed for physical simulation. Unlike the
visual mesh (the representation we observe on the screen), a collision mesh is utilized to detect
collisions and calculate contact between objects within a physics engine. In a `.urdf` file, the
collision mesh is defined within the `<collision>` tag, distinct from the visual mesh.

The precision of our collision mesh in mirroring the actual shape of the robot hand significantly
influences the accuracy of our simulation's predictions and responses to interactions, thereby
enhancing realism.
However, the quest for a highly realistic collision mesh can demand substantial computational
resources. **Meshes with higher realism often contain more vertices and faces**, which can notably
increase the computational requirements for running the simulation. This could potentially slow down
the simulation. Sometimes, it might be beneficial to ignore minor physical details in the
simulation to simplify the problem.

Consequently, crafting a collision mesh for a robot is a non-trivial task. This complexity is
especially amplified in the case of dexterous hands, which possess a much larger number of links
compared to a robot arm. The task demands thorough attention and cannot be completely automated via
scripting.

In this blog, we will navigate through this challenge. By utilizing a specific robot hand as
example, we will illustrate the step-by-step process of creating collision mesh for a robot hand.

## Example: Creating a Model for the SVH Hand

In this tutorial, we are going to walk you through a detailed process of creating a collision mesh
model using the manufacturer-provided URDF, specifically for
the [SCHUNK SVH Hand](https://github.com/SCHUNK-SE-Co-KG/schunk_svh_ros_driver/tree/main/schunk_svh_description/urdf).
The original URDF from SCHUNK employs the same mesh file for collision as well as visual
representation. This approach could lead to significant issues as many simulators often default to
converting the imported collision mesh into a convex hull.

Below, we present the collision mesh derived from the original URDF. The left image depicts the
original collision geometry, while the right one represents the contact force of self-penetration
during motion. As you can intuitively imagine, loading this model directly into your simulator
would lead to unpredictable behavior due to the self-collision causing random movement. The red
arrow indicates the contact force, with deeper red signifying greater force. You can visualize this
using
the [ContactViewer](https://github.com/dexsuite/dex-urdf/blob/fc3c16cf255604078ff7f08ba08d8cacc31a3b3e/example/render_urdf_sapien.py#L35)
tool.

To address the problem identified above, we'll manually remodel the collision mesh. There are
several methods for this, such as using primitives like a box or sphere for collision
representation, employing convex decomposition derived from the visual mesh, or even designing a
more tailored solution.

### Building Collision Mesh: Single Primitive Approach

Let's start with the base, corresponding to `base10.dae`.

:::warning
It's important to note that using a `.dae` file to represent a visual mesh can lead to
inconsistencies across different URDF parsers. This is why DexSuite does not use `.dae` files for
visual meshes. While this is not the main focus of this blog post, we thought it was worth
mentioning.
:::

Next, import the visual mesh into your preferred graphics software, such as Blender. We notice that
the shape of this mesh closely resembles a cylinder. Therefore, let's attempt to use a cylinder to
represent the collision mesh. Usually, it's more efficient to use a primitive than a mesh file for
collision representation.

```xml

<visual>
    <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 -0.032"/>
    <geometry>
        <mesh filename="package://schunk_svh_description/meshes/base10.dae"/>
    </geometry>
</visual>
```

Remember to position the visual mesh in Blender based on the pose tag within the URDF, which has
a `z=-0.032` position. Then, create a cylinder primitive and adjust its size and position to align
with the visual mesh.

|  Visual Mesh in Blender   | Created Cylinder Primitive in Blender |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| ![cylinder](base_dae.png) |     ![cylinder](base_blender.png)     |

Afterward, we can copy-paste the cylinder information into the URDF as illustrated below. When you
load the modified URDF into your simulator, the collision mesh will now be represented by a
simple cylinder.

```xml title="schunk_svh_hand_right.urdf"

<link name="right_hand_base_link">
    <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
    <visual>
        <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 -0.032"/>
        <geometry>
            <mesh filename="package://schunk_svh_description/meshes/base10.dae"/>
        </geometry>
    </visual>
    <collision>
        <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 -0.009"/>
        <geometry>
            <cylinder radius="0.045" length="0.045"/>
        </geometry>
    </collision>
</link>
```

:::tip
Several simulators, like SAPIEN, IsaacGym, and IsaacSim, do not include a cylinder as a built-in
primitive. Hence, the URDF parser will interpret the cylinder as a triangle mesh internally. This
implies that for a cylinder, using a cylinder primitive in URDF or saving it as a mesh file will
yield identical results in simulation collision detection. However, for simplicity, we recommend
using the `<cylinder>` tag.

### Building Collision Mesh: Multi Primitive Approach

Now, let's handle the palm, which corresponds to `h10.dae` and `h11.dae`. We'll begin with h10.
This part has a more complex structure than the previous ones, and it appears that a single
primitive cannot approximate it. Instead, we might need to use multiple primitives, such as three
boxes. You do not need to worry that the overlapping between different boxes since the collision
meshes of the same link will never collide each other.

| Visual Mesh in Blender | Created Box Primitives in Blender |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|  ![box](h10_dae.png)   |      ![box](h10_blender.png)      |

**Why are some parts of the visual mesh not covered by the boxes, and why are others over-covered?**

**Over-coverage Reasoning:**
Typically, the collision mesh can be slightly larger than the actual shape for safety
considerations. For instance, we expect our robot to manipulate objects with its fingers, not the
hand base. The collision mesh for this part is primarily designed to prevent unwanted penetration,
between the hand and the object, or between the hand and the robot arm.

**Under-coverage Reasoning:**
For parts under-covered by the box, finger links are usually present, making these areas hard to
reach for external objects. Moreover, the visual mesh does not represent the actual robot; it merely
serves as a surrogate for its real counterpart that we do not need to follow precisely. In practice,
modeling this uncovered part could lead to unwanted self-collision in the initial state.

Following the same design principle, we can also model the collision mesh corresponding to `h11`.
However, this is a complex design problem, and there isn't a unique solution for design. You'll
often find that the design choices are heavily dependent on your manipulation task with the robot
model. Remember, the modeling process is always iterative: you build collision meshes and put them
into a simulator to observe the outcomes. If something unexpected occurs, such as undesired
self-collision, you should update your collision mesh design.
When building models in DexSuite, we extensively
use [simulation for motion checking](https://github.com/dexsuite/dex-urdf/blob/main/example/render_urdf_sapien.py)
to enhance the modeling process.

### Building Collision Mesh: Convex Mesh Approach

Let's now address the collision of index finger, is related to the URDF
links `right_hand_virtual_l`, `right_hand_l`, `right_hand_p`, and `right_hand_t`. We can
model `right_hand_virtual_l` as a spherical primitive using the aforementioned method. For the other
three meshes, we'll use **convex decomposition**.

Convex meshes are highly favored in physical simulations. Primitives such as spheres, boxes,
cylinders, and capsules are all convex. To transform non-convex visual meshes into convex ones, we
employ a process known as convex decomposition. This technique involves deconstructing complex,
non-convex shapes into several simpler, convex shapes. It is an algorithmic process, eliminating the
need for manual labor. More details about convex decomposition can be found
in [this article](https://simulately.wiki/docs/toolkits/ConvexDecomp).

While primitives are ideal for efficient collision detection, they may not be the best
representation for some robot links. Approximating these links with primitives could either use too
many shapes or not accurately represent the actual link. This is especially true for links with
frequent contacts, like fingertips, where the collision shape's alignment with the actual
counterpart is crucial.

The [CoACD](https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD) tool is highly beneficial for performing convex
decomposition. Here's a simple script to install CoACD and use it to generate decomposed meshes for
the index finger links using default parameters:

```shell
pip3 install coacd
coacd -i f11.obj -o f11_collision.obj
coacd -i f12.obj -o f12_collision.obj
coacd -i f13.obj -o f13_collision.obj
```

For simple meshes such as the collision mesh of
an [XArm link](https://github.com/dexsuite/dex-urdf/tree/main/robots/arms/xarm7/meshes/collision),
the default parameters work well. However, for `f11`, the default parameters produce overly complex
convex meshes. In such cases, we could consider using a smaller decomposition resolution, denoted
by `-t`. A larger value implies a lower granularity. More details on tuning these parameters can be
found on the original [CoACD Github page](https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD).

```shell
coacd -i f11.obj -o -t 0.1 f11_collision.obj
```

|  Original Visual Mesh   |   CoACD with Default Params   |     CoACD with `-t 0.1`      |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| 1 SubMesh, 508 Vertices |  62 SubMeshes, 5083 Vertices  | 29 SubMeshes, 3025 Vertices  | 
|   ![visual](f11.png)    | ![default convex](f11_62.png) | ![simple convex](f11_29.png) |

We can apply a similar method to create convex decompositions for other finger links. While this
might seem adequate, you might find that your URDF model is experiencing intensive self-collision,
even in its resting pose. So, what's the issue? We'll delve into this in the bext blog.
