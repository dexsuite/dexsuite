# Usage Consideration

### IsaacGym

The URDF provided in DexSuite utilizes either `.obj` or `.glb` files (for glb version URDF). To
ensure proper functioning, it's crucial to set `flip_visual_attachment=False`. This tag modifies the
up and forward axis as established in the mesh file, typically a `.dae` file. For our URDF model,
this is unnecessary and enabling it could result in wrong mesh parsing behavior.

```python
from isaacgym import gymapi

asset_option = gymapi.AssetOptions()
asset_option.flip_visual_attachments = False
```
